The round robin algorithm is preemptive unlike FCFS anf SJF.
It can be more useful in situations when priority should be equal
but sometimes its average TAT and WT can be worse than for FCFS anf SJF.
For example, if number of proccesses = 3, arrival times = 0 0 0, burst times = 1 30 1,
then SJF will be better.

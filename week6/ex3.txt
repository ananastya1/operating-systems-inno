The round robin algorithm is preemptive unlike FCFS anf SJF.
It can be more useful in situations when priority should be equal (fair allocation of CPU)
but sometimes its average TAT and WT can be worse than for SJF because of process switching.
For example, if number of proccesses = 3, arrival times = 0 0 0, burst times = 1 30 1, quantum = 2
then SJF will be better. But if number of proccesses = 5, arrival times = 1 33 2 4 1, burst times = 2 3 1 2 50, 
quantum = 2 RR will be more efficient. Its average TAT = 14.8, average WT = 3.2 whereas SJf results are 17.4 
and  5. 8 respectfully. Results for FCFS are worse in both cases. So, for long proccesses RR can be useful but
in other cases SJf is better. FCFS is less efficient almost in all cases.

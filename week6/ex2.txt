SJF (ex2) is more efficient than FCFS (ex1) because SJF can reduce the 
average waiting time, as short processes will be executed first in ex2
whereas in the ex1 processes run just in arrival order.
For example, if number of proccesses = 3, arrival times = 0 0 0, burst times = 1 30 1,
then average TAT for FCFS = 21.3 and average TAT for SJF = 11,7, WT for FCFS = 10,7 
and WT for SJF = 1. It confirms that the second algorithm is optimized better.

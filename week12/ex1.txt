dma1 is controller of Direct Memory Access. It is used to control the data transfer between memory and I/O device without the processor involvement.
pic1 is Peripheral Interface Controller. It works as a standard microcontroller that has small processors, memory, registers and storage. Typically, pic1 enhances I/O operations from a peripheral devices by separating I/O-based programs and data from CPU.
timer1 is specialized type of clock. A timer can be set to interrupt the computer after a specified period.
